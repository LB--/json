JSON
====

My personal JSON parser in C++14. Why yet another JSON parser? To support duplicate keys!

This project is (not yet) available via [biicode](http://www.biicode.com/), just `#include <LB/json/.hpp>`

## Building

If you are using GCC/MinGW/clang, make sure you run `bii configure -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++14"` before running `bii build`.
